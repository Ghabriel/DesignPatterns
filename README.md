# DesignPatterns
Implementations and examples of design patterns in several programming languages.

#### Notes:
* The [non-virtual interface (NVI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-virtual_interface_pattern) pattern is extensively used to further improve several implemented patterns

#### Relevant guidelines:
* R.30: Take smart pointers as parameters only to explicitly express lifetime semantics ([source](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md))
* Express that a function will store and share ownership of a heap object using a by-value shared_ptr parameter ([source](https://herbsutter.com/2013/06/05/gotw-91-solution-smart-pointer-parameters/)).
